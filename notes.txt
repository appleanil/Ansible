roles in ansible
================

Roles in Ansible are a way to organize playbooks into reusable components.

Creating a Role
----------------

--> To create a role, you can use the ansible-galaxy command:

ansible-galaxy init httpd


Directory Structure for the Role

The role will have a similar structure to before but will include a `templates` directory for the `index.html` template file, 
and a `vars` directory for the `vars.yaml` file.


roles/
├── apache
│   ├── tasks/
│   │   └── main.yml
│   ├── templates/
│   │   └── index.html
│   ├── vars/
│   │   └── main.yml  # This will reference vars.yaml (the file you mentioned)
│   ├── defaults/
│   │   └── main.yml  # Default values for any variables
│   ├── handlers/
│   │   └── main.yml  # Handlers for tasks like restarting services
│   └── meta/
│       └── main.yml


Step-by-Step Conversion
------------------------

1. Create the role directory structure.
2. Move the tasks to the `tasks/main.yml` file.
3. Move the `index.html` template to the `templates/` directory.
4. Move the `vars.yaml` to the `vars/main.yml` file (if necessary).
5. Define the handler to restart the HTTP service in `handlers/main.yml`.


Role Files
-----------

# 1. sudo vi roles/httpd/tasks/main.yml

yaml
---
# tasks/main.yml

- name: Install httpd HTTP Server
  yum:
    name: "{{ apache_package_name }}"
    state: present
  tags: install

- name: Ensure httpd is started and enabled
  service:
    name: httpd
    state: started
    enabled: true
  tags: configure

- name: Copy custom index.html to the web root
  template:
    src: index.html  # Path to your local index.html template
    dest: /var/www/html/index.html  # Destination on the target server
  notify:
    - restarting httpd
  tags: deploy


# 2. sudo vi roles/httpd/templates/index.html

Place your `index.html` file in this directory. This will be a template that Ansible can process, and if necessary,
you can include variables in this file (e.g., `{{ some_variable }}`) to make it dynamic.

Example `index.html` (with a simple template):


<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Welcome to Apache</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to {{ apache_server_name }}!</h1>
    <p>This page is served by Apache on {{ ansible_hostname }}.</p>
</body>
</html>


# 3. sudo vi roles/httpd/vars/main.yml

Here, you can define the variables used by the playbook. For example, you can define the `apache_package_name` or 
any other variables that make the role more configurable.

yaml
---
# vars/main.yml

apache_package_name: httpd
apache_server_name: "My Apache Server"


# 4. sudo vi roles/httpd/defaults/main.yml

You can specify default values for variables here. These defaults can be overridden by the `vars/main.yml` or playbook.

yaml
---
# defaults/main.yml

apache_package_name: httpd
apache_server_name: "Default Apache Server"


# 5. sudo vi roles/httpd/handlers/main.yml

This file will contain the handler to restart the `httpd` service.

yaml
---
# handlers/main.yml

- name: restarting httpd
  service:
    name: httpd
    state: restarted


# 6. sudo vi roles/httpd/meta/main.yml

This file is for role metadata, including dependencies. For now, you can leave it empty unless you have dependencies.

yaml
---
# meta/main.yml

dependencies: []



Using the Role in a Playbook
-----------------------------

Now that the role is created, you can use it in your playbook by specifying the `vars.yaml` file and referencing the role.

# Main Playbook

yaml
---
- name: Install and configure httpd on all servers
  hosts: all  
  gather_facts: no  # set to yes so we can use ansible facts like ansible_hostname
  become: true  
  vars_files:
    - vars.yaml  # This file will be referenced in the playbook
  roles:
    - httpd


# `vars.yaml` File (if it's separate from `vars/main.yml`)

If you are using an external `vars.yaml` file, it can be placed alongside the playbook:

yaml
---
# vars.yaml

apache_server_name: "Custom Apache Server"


 Final Notes:

- Modularity: The role is now modular and can be reused across multiple playbooks.
- Customizability: You can customize the Apache server name, package name, and other variables by modifying `vars/main.yml` or the `vars.yaml` file.
- Template: The `index.html` template allows for dynamic content generation based on Ansible facts or variables. For example, `{{ ansible_hostname }}` 
  can be used to display the host’s name in the web page.










Ansible vault
==============

Ansible Vault is a feature that allows you to encrypt sensitive data such as passwords, SSH keys, and API tokens inside Ansible playbooks or inventory files. 
This ensures that sensitive information is securely stored and only accessible with a password.

---

 Step 1: Create an Encrypted File
---------------------------------
First, create a vault-encrypted file to store sensitive data.


ansible-vault create secret.yml


- Enter a vault password (remember this, you’ll need it later).
- A text editor opens. Add the following sensitive data:


db_password: "SuperSecretPassword123"
api_key: "abcdef1234567890"



Step 2: View the Encrypted File
-------------------------------

Now, check how Ansible Vault has encrypted your file:

cat secret.yml

✅ Expected Output:  
The file should appear fully encrypted, something like this:


$ANSIBLE_VAULT;1.1;AES256
6162636465663738393031323334353637383930...



Step 3: Edit the Encrypted File
-------------------------------

To modify the vault-encrypted file, use:  ansible-vault edit secret.yml

🔹 Enter the vault password.  
🔹 Make changes to the file (e.g., update the password).  
🔹 Save and exit.


Step 4: Decrypt the File (Optional)
-----------------------------------

If you need to remove encryption and see plain text:


ansible-vault decrypt secret.yml


Now, check the file:


cat secret.yml


✅ It should now be readable as normal YAML.

---

Step 5: Re-Encrypt the File
-------

To re-encrypt a decrypted file:


ansible-vault encrypt secret.yml


Enter the vault password, and it will be encrypted again.

---

Step 6: Use Vault in a Playbook
-------

Let’s create a playbook that uses the vault-encrypted variables.

🔹 Create `playbook.yml`:

yaml
---
- name: Test Ansible Vault
  hosts: all
  vars_files:
    - secret.yml
  tasks:
    - name: Print sensitive variables
      debug:
        msg: "The database password is {{ db_password }}"



Run the playbook with Vault --------------> ansible-playbook vaulttest.yaml --ask-vault-pass


✅ Expected Output:
json
TASK [Print sensitive variables] 
ok: [localhost] => {
    "msg": "The database password is SuperSecretPassword123"
}



Step 7: Use Vault with a Password File
--------------------------------------

Instead of manually entering the vault password, store it in a file:

1️⃣ Create a password file:

echo "kkdevops" > vault-password.txt
chmod 600 vault-password.txt


2️⃣ Run the playbook using the password file:

ansible-playbook vaulttest.yaml --vault-password-file password.txt 

vaulttest.yaml encrypt lo untadi dani decript cheysi password.txt lo show cheysthundi



1. ansible-vault create secret.yml             ----------> to create secret.yaml
2. ansible-vault view secret.yml               ----------> to view encrypted file content
3. ansible-vault edit secret.yml               ----------> to edit encrypted file
4. ansible-vault decrypt secret.yml            ----------> to decrypt (remove encryption)
5. ansible-vault encrypt secret.yml            ----------> to encrypt the file again
6. ansible-playbook site.yml --ask-vault-pass  ----------> to run playbook by asking decrypt/vault password
7. ansible-playbook site.yml --vault-password-file password.txt ----------> to run playbook using password file
- Use `--ask-vault-pass` or `--vault-password-file` for automation  


Bonus: Encrypt an Entire Playbook
---------------------------------
Instead of encrypting just variables, encrypt an entire playbook --------> ansible-vault encrypt playbook.yml


To run playbook by asking decrypt/vault password                --------> ansible-playbook playbook.yml --ask-vault-pass


NOTE : if you want to reset the password ,pls use this command ---------> ansible-vault rekey abc.yaml


⚠️ Important
❌ There is NO way to recover a lost vault password.
✅ Always keep a backup of unencrypted files before encrypting.





📝 Introduction to Ansible Dynamic Inventory
==============================================
Ansible Inventory is the list of hosts (servers) that Ansible manages. By default, Ansible uses a static inventory file (e.g., inventory.ini), 
where hosts and groups are manually defined.

However, in cloud environments like AWS, servers are dynamic—they are created and terminated frequently. Manually updating inventory files 
becomes inefficient and error-prone.

🔹 What is Ansible Dynamic Inventory?
=====================================

Ansible Dynamic Inventory automatically retrieves real-time information about cloud instances, virtual machines, or containers from external sources 
like AWS, Azure, GCP, or Kubernetes.

Instead of maintaining a static hosts file, Ansible queries the cloud provider’s API and dynamically builds the inventory.

💡 Why Use Dynamic Inventory?
✅ No Manual Updates – Automatically detects new servers and removes old ones.
✅ Works with Cloud – Fetches real-time AWS EC2 instances, Azure VMs, or Kubernetes pods.
✅ Uses Tags and Filters – Group hosts based on tags (e.g., all web servers, db servers).
✅ Efficient and Scalable – Ideal for large-scale cloud environments.




---

 **📌 Prerequisites**
1. **AWS Account** with proper IAM permissions.
2. **Ansible installed** on a control node (Linux/macOS).
3. **Python and Boto3** installed on the control node.
4. **AWS CLI installed** and configured with access keys.

---

 **1️⃣ Install Required Dependencies**
Ensure you have the required Python packages installed:

sudo yum update -y
sudo yum install python3 -y
sudo yum install python3-pip -y

pip3 --version


sudo pip install boto3 botocore

#pip install ansible


---

 **2️⃣ Configure AWS Credentials**
Ansible needs access to AWS. You can set up your credentials using:

AWS cli
-------
curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
sudo yum install unzip -y
unzip awscliv2.zip
sudo ./aws/install
aws --version






aws configure



[default]
aws_access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_KEY
region = ap-south-1



---

 **3️⃣ Enable Ansible AWS Collection**
Ensure the AWS collection is installed:


ansible-galaxy collection install amazon.aws


---

 **4️⃣ Create a Dynamic Inventory File**
Ansible provides a **dynamic inventory plugin** for AWS.

📌 Create an inventory configuration file:

mkdir -p ~/ansible/inventory
cd ~/ansible/inventory


Create a file `aws_ec2.yml`:

plugin: amazon.aws.aws_ec2
regions:
  - ap-south-1
filters:
  instance-state-name: running
keyed_groups:
  - key: tags.Name
    prefix: "tag_"
compose:
  ansible_host: public_ip_address


---

 **5️⃣ Verify the Dynamic Inventory**
Run the following command to ensure Ansible can fetch instances:


ansible-inventory -i aws_ec2.yml --list



If everything is set up correctly, you should see a JSON output of AWS EC2 instances.

---

 **6️⃣ Run Ansible Commands on AWS Instances**
 **📌 Example: Ping all AWS EC2 Instances**

ansible all -i aws_ec2.yml -m ping -u ec2-user --private-key /home/ec2-user/kkdevopsbl3b2.pem


ansible tag__Hosts -i aws_ec2.yml -m ping -u ec2-user --private-key /home/ec2-user/kkdevopsbl3b2.pem



 **📌 Example: Run a Command on all EC2 instances**


 ansible all -i aws_ec2.yml -m shell -a "uptime" -u ec2-user --private-key /home/ec2-user/kkdevopsbl3b2.pem


---

 **7️⃣ Create & Run a Playbook**
📌 **Create a playbook** `install_apache.yml`:
yaml
- name: Install Apache on AWS EC2
  hosts: tag_WebServers
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Install Apache
      ansible.builtin.yum:
        name: httpd
        state: present

    - name: Start Apache Service
      ansible.builtin.service:
        name: httpd
        state: started
        enabled: yes


📌 **Run the playbook**:

ansible-playbook -i aws_ec2.yml gitInstall.yaml -u ec2-user --private-key /home/ec2-user/kkdevopsbl3b2.pem



---

 **📌 Summary**
1. Install `boto3` and `ansible-galaxy collection install amazon.aws`
2. Set up AWS credentials.
3. Create `aws_ec2.yml` for dynamic inventory.
4. Test with `ansible-inventory --list`
5. Run Ansible commands on AWS EC2 instances.
6. Deploy Playbooks dynamically.
